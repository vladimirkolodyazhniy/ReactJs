        E-mail (electronic mail) is the exchange of computer-stored messages by telecommunication.
        (Some publications spell it email; we prefer the currently more established spelling of e-mail.)
        E-mail messages are usually encoded in ASCII text. However, you can also send non-text files, such as graphic images and sound files,
        as attachments sent in binary streams. E-mail was one of the first uses of the Internet and is still the most popular use.
        A large percentage of the total traffic over the Internet is e-mail. E-mail can also be exchanged between online service provider users and
        in networks other than the Internet, both public and private.
